# FLMidi

This is my own library to parse MIDI files using Kotlin language/environment.

This is in development and should help me get binary information that lies in MIDI files and, for example, parse then to other formats.

This project is being built using some oline resources:
- [A tutorial about MIDI specification](https://www.mobilefish.com/tutorials/midi/midi_quickguide_specification.html#table_6);
- [Standard MIDI file format](http://www.music.mcgill.ca/~ich/classes/mumt306/StandardMIDIfileformat.html).

# Usage

Currently is in a rough development phase but should be fine to use in some pushes.
